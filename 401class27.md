# Class 27 - `useState()` Hook

## Reading

### Introducing Hooks

1. What was the motivation for introducing Hooks?
    - Ability to extract and reuse stateful logic
    - Ability to split a component into smaller functions based on relation rather than a split based on lifecycle methods
    - Abiity to use more of React's features without classes
1. What changes are important regarding implementing Hooks versus Component Classes?  
    - ES6 class syntax vs. functional components
    - setState function vs. useState Hook
    - componentDidMount vs. useEffect
    - ability to reuse stateful logic with Hooks
1. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing __component hierarchy__.

### hooks api

1. Name two rules imposed by React Hook usage.  
    - Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
    - Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
1. How would you identify a custom Hook and why might you create one?  
    A custom Hooks' function name starts with 'use', and it calls other Hooks.  
    Custom Hooks allow us to reuse a stateful logic between components. 


### the state hook

1. What is a Hook?  
Hooks are functions that allow us to use state and other React features without writing a class.
1. When would I use the useState Hook?  
You can use the `useState` Hook to add React state to function components.
1. If you were to add React state to a function component by declaring a state variable:
    1. What does calling useState do?  
    calling `useState` declares a state varible (replacement for `this.state` in classes)
    1. What do we pass to useState as an argument?  
    initial state (e.g. `0`)
    1. What does useState return?  
    `useState` returns the current state and a function that updates it

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
    My goals are to learn how to use Hooks in functional components as a replacement for state in classes and implement in the related lab.
