# Class 34 Reading: API Integration

## [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the difference between a query string parameter and a path parameter.  

    A query string parameter is a key-value pair that is appended to the end of a URL after a `?` to specify additional data that sould be sent to the server. For example: `http://our-site.com/v3/search?q=stuff&sort=date`

    A path parameter is part of the actual URL path and used to specify a specific resource or object. For example: `http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things`

1. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be, given the following information:
    1. Domain: `http://our-site.com`
    1. `v3`
    1. model name: `stuff`
    1. id: `things`

    `http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things`

1. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.  
    The  interface of a dynamic API provides a way for different applications to exchange information and interact with each other, without having to understand the underlying technical details. It's like a translator that helps different systems talk to each other in a language they can both understand.

## [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.  
Middleware to implement basic and bearer auth:

    - Basic (username + password) to be used on the `/signin` route only
    - i.e. `app.post('/signin', basicAuthentication, (req, res) => { ... })`

    - Bearer (token) to be used on any other route in the server that requires a logged in user
    - i.e. `app.get('/secretstuff', tokenAuthentication, (req, res) => { ... })`

     Middleware for handling authorization:
    - To be run after Bearer Middleware on routes to be protected
    - Accepts a “capability” as a parameter
    - i.e. `app.delete('/secretstuff', tokenAuthRequired, capability('delete'), (req, res) => { ... })`

1. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.

    - The third-party application requests authorization from the user
    - The user is redirected to the authorization server
    - The user is asked to log in
    - The user grants access
    - The authorization server issues an access token
    - The third-party application accesses the user's resources

1. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.  
In an organization, each employee are given roles and have access to certain resources and actions based on their role. With Role Based Access Control, we are able to grant or deny access to resources on a network, based on the user's role and its capabilities.
