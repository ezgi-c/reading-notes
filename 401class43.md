## Open-Source Software Contribution

These articles will help you learn more about open-source contributions.

[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

This article lists resources for first time OSS contributers. I decided to use the following resource to learn how to make my first contribution: 
>_[First contributions](https://github.com/multunus/first-contributions) is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project._

- I started by forking the repository: https://github.com/ezgi-c/first-contributions
- Next, I cloned the forked repo on my machine
- I worked from a new branch `first`
- Following the instructions on the guide, I added my name and GitHub page url to the `Contributers.md`
- I ACP'd the change I made
- On GitHub, I made a pull request from my branch to the base repository.

>_Congrats! You just completed the standard fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request workflow that you'll often encounter as a contributor!_
