# Class 42 Readings: Ethics in Tech

_Review at least one article from __both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below__ and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?_

_For each article that you choose, write a minimum 5 sentences (1 paragraph). Each reflection should be something of substance and of an acceptable quality._

## Ethics in the workplace

[Microsoft Employees demand end of ICE contract](https://web.archive.org/web/20211124172013/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

This was an impactful article to read. I gravitated toward this article as immigration policy is something I have strong feelings about. I was inspired by the employees' willingness to take on their employer to promote human rights and ethical boundaries. I was also saddened by the company's lack of reponse and action to the workers' demands. Their ingeniune and dishonest statements were also disheartening.

## Ethics in Technology

[First, we had suspects](https://acroll.medium.com/first-we-had-suspects-40ebdb4d5fd)

The author starts the article making a comparison between how law enforcement handled crime in the past and how they do it today.  
The author states that 50 years ago _"First, you had a suspect; then you collected data",_ and today the order is reversed, _"you have data, and find suspects"_  

Next, the author describes the field of 'predictive policing' as using data to guess where crimes are most likely to happen. 

The author finds __2 serious problems__ with this technological field:

(I did not want to paraphrase this section as it was so succinctly written, and I thought was important to showcase in the author's own words)

>- _Its algorithms shit where they eat._ Software that predicts where crime will occur can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When more police patrol a hotspot, they make more arrests, which lowers property values, which makes it harder for a healthy community to thrive because of a drop in tax revenue.
>- It suffers from _reporting bias._ If you leave a mattress out on the street in the rich Oakland Heights area, everyone calls the authorities. If you leave one out in the poor parts of Oakland, someone takes a nap. So the source data is questionable in the first place.
