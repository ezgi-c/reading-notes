## Code 102 Notes - June 20, 2022

Today was the first day of lecture for Code 102 at CodeFellows. Following are the topics we covered:

- **Types of Learning**
  - Sandbox learning gives autonomy to student, learning through trial and error.
  - The other type of learning (i dont remember what it is called) involved learning through consuming the information given by the instructor.
  - We will be utilizing both types of learning in this class, with *Sandbox Learning* being the most valuable as it teaches us how to learn on our own.
  - Growth Mindset: developing our skills and capabilities through effort rather than settling with a fixed mindset of accepting what we readily can do without effort.
- **Markdown**
  - A coding language that is simpler than HTML
  - not WYSIWYG
  - Web pages can be formated and generated on GitHub using Markdown 
  - some examples:
  
   ```
    
   *italic*   
   
   **bold**
