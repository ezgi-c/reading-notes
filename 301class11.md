    | SQL         | NoSQL |
    | ----------- | ----------- |
    | relational      | non-relational/distributed      |
    | table based   | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores       |
    | predefined schema    | dynamic schema       |
    | vertically scalable   | horizontally scalable        |
    | uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data  | queries are focused on collection of documents        |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  
    complex queries
1. Give a real world example.  
    MySQL
1. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  
    hierarchical data storage
1. Give a real world example.  
    Hbase
1. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?  
    NoSQL
1. Which type of database is best for scalability?  
    NoSQL
