# Class 39 Readings: Redux - Additional Topics

## Redux Toolkit (RTK)

1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?  

>- "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"  
>- "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"  
>- "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

1. What does `configureStore()` do?  

- wraps `createStore` to provide simplified configuration options and defaults
- can automatically combine slice reducers
- adds Redux middleware
- includes `redux-thunk` by default

1. How would I use `createSlice()`?  

- pass it an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value
- it will generate a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types

## MobX

1. What is Mobx?  
Mobx is a popular state management library used with React.

1. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?  
Mobx does this by making sure everything that can be derived from the application state will be derived automatically.

1. How would we build a reactive user interface?  
We can use the `observer` wrapper from mobx to wrap the React component to keep it in sync with the state.
