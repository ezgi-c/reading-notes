# Class 05 - HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

## Using Images In HTML, Common Image Types, Choosing Image Formats

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?  

    The `alt` attribute is used in the `img` element. It contains description of the media. It serves multiple purposes. One purpose is to make the image more accessible to screen readers which read out the description of the image to users with limited vision. Another purpose of the attribute is to act as a placeholder in case the image fails to load and still lets the user know what the image contains.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

    We can improve accessibility of images by using the `alt` attribute.

3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.

    The `figure` element is useful when we want to add captions to images.

4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

    `gif` is a simple image and animation format. `svg` is a format for images created by code.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

    Lossless WebP or PNG to preserve the details especially if the screenshot contains text.

## Using Color in CSS, Styling HTML Text Elements

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

    Background color is like the color of the paper on a notebook, and foreground color is the color of the text.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

    I would come up with a pleasant or relevant color scheme while referring to color theory.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

    We should consider font size, color, weight, font-family, spacing, and so on.

4. What do `font-size`, `font-weight`, and `font-style` do to HTML text elements?

    `font-size` sets the size of the text, `font-weight` the thickness, and `font-style` whether the text will be normal, italic, or oblique.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an `h1` element.

    One way would be use the `text-align` property and center the contents. Another way would be set the left and right margins of the element.
