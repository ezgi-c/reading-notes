# Class 13 - Message Queues

## Socket.io Chat Example

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.  

- Create a basic chat application using Node.js, Express and Socket.IO library for two-way communication between a client and server.
- Begin by installing the necessary dependencies.
- Set up an HTTP server using Express and create a route handler to serve an HTML file.
- How to use Socket.IO to ass real-time functionality to the chat application.

1. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?  

- The console log `'listening on *:3000'`
- When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000` in their browser, they will be served the HTML file.

1. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?  
We would use the `broadcast` flag. For example: `socket.broadcast.emit('event', data);`

## Rooms

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?  
A room is a way to group sockets together, allowing us to broadcast messages to clients in a specific room rather than all clients connected to the server.
1. How do you join a room?  
We can join a room by calling the following method on a socket: `join(roomName)`.
1. how do you leave a room?  
by calling the `leave(roomName)` method on a socket.

## Namespaces

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?  
A Namespace is a communication channel that has its own set of connected sockets, rooms and event handlers. It allaws us to create multiple separate communication channels for separating different types of communication.
1. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)  

- event handlers
- rooms
- middlewares

1. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces  
A possible use case is to create separate name spaces for different types of users. For example, one for admins and one for general users.
