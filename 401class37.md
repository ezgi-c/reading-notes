# Class 37 Reading: Redux - Combined Reducers

## Multiple Reducers Example

1. Why create multiple reducers?  

We create multiple reducers to manage state of separate parts of the application. This helps us obey the Single Responsibility Principle and decouple logic. Each reducer should have 1 part of the state to manage.

1. How would you combine multiple reducers?  

We import the reducers from source and create a keyed object for them. Example:

```js
import todoReducer from './todo.store.js';
import itemReducer from './item.store.js';

let reducers = combineReducers({
  todo: todoReducer,
  item: itemReducer,
});
```

1. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?

>When state is immutable, it cannot be accidentally modified, which can happen with mutable state.

With Redux, it is easy to manage the state as an immutable object in the form of the `store`. The state can onle be changed by `actions` that are `dispatch`ed to the store, which trigger `reducers` to update the state based on the action.

## Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers

1. `combineReducers` is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ____ __Redux reducers_______ .
1. Explain how `combineReducers` assembles the new state tree.  
To assemble the new state tree, `combineReducers` calls each slicer reducer with its current slice of state and the current action, giving the slice reducer a chance to respond and update its slice of state if needed
1. How would you define initial state in an app using `combineReducers`?  

```js
import todoReducer from './todo.store.js';
import itemReducer from './item.store.js';

const reducers = combineReducers({
  todo: todoReducer,
  item: itemReducer,
});

const initialState = {
  todo: /* initial state for todo */,
  item: /* initial state for item */
};
```

## Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax

1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?  
Splitting reducing functions into smaller, more focused functions can improve readability, maintainability, and scalability.
1. The ___`combineReducers` __ helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to __ `createStore` __.
1. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?  

>A popular convention is to name reducers after the state slices they manage, so you can use ES6 property shorthand notation: `combineReducers({ counter, todos })`.  
This is equivalent to writing `combineReducers({ counter: counter, todos: todos })`.
