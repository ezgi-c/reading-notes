## About me

My name is Ezgi. I am a mom of one human and 2 fur babies. I love to solve problems and be creative. My background is in Psychology as well as customer service.
I am originally from Istanbul, Turkey and I have lived in Seattle and the PNW for the past 20 years. I enjoy spending time outdoors on beaches and woods.
I have always been interested in computers and technology and I am excited to begin my journey into a career in tech.
