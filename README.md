In their blog post called [*How You Can Benefit from A Growth Mindset*](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), Steve Haffenden talks about their struggles with moving past a "fixed mindset" towards a "growth mindset". A **growth mindset** is explained as seeing the mind as a tool that can be sharpened to become more efficient, creative and capable through effort and practice. 

> A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

It is true that many of us fall into the pitfall of seeing our talents and capabilities as a given rather than being able to develop them through work. I can relate to what Haffenden shares about the discomfort that accompanies the growth process. I can count the times I gave up on an endeaveour when I wasn't naturally successful at it. 

## Reminders to Stay in a Growth Mindset
It can be easy to revert back to a fixed mindset. Here are some reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
- Remember that the discomfort that comes with growth is to be expected and leads to developing new skills and capabilities.
- Remember to take a break when stuck and come back later to a challenge.
- Remember to see criticism as an opportunity for growth rather than as evidence of not being good at something.
