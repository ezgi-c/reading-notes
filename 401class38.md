# Class 38 Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## async actions

1. Why use Redux middleware?  

We need Redux middleware to enable async logic. The store only is able to execute synchronous actions and any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store. Middleware have access to `dispatch` and `getState`, which means we can write async logic in the middleware and have the ability to interact with the redux store by dispatching actions.

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.

Redux Async Data Flow adds one more step (middleware) to the normal synchronous Redux data flow.

- Event handler dispatches an action
- Middleware intercepts the dispatch
  - makes an API call with action payload (or another async logic)
  - dispatches the action to the reducer with response data and state from the store
- Reducer updates state
- UI renders new state

3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?  
We can use Redux Thunk middleware to write async logic and dispatch actions.

## thunk middleware

1. Why would you need `redux-thunk` middleware? 

`redux-thunk` is a built in middleware in RTK. We can use it to write async logic while accessing redux store state and dispatching actions.

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a __ __function__ __ instead of an action.

1. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.  

A return value from the inner thunk function can be made available in the following ways:
  
- returning a value directly if called synchronously,
- using a callback function if called asynchronously,
- if the inner thunk function returns a promise, the calling function can use the Promise's `then` method to handle the return value.
