[Scaling Up with Reducer and Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context)

1. How do `useReducer` and `useContext` work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)  


We can combine `reducer` with `context` to let any component read and update state above it. A `reducer` helps keep the event handlers short and concise. But we have to explicitly pass down the state and the event handlers that are only available in the top-level component. In a larger app with tens or hundreds of components, the passing of the state becomes cumbersome.

Alternative to passing the state and the functions through props, is putting the state and the functions into `context`. `context` makes them available to be read by any component it wraps.

Steps to combine `reducer` and `context`:

> To provide state and the dispatch function to components below:  
    1. Create two contexts (for state and for dispatch functions).
    2. Provide both contexts from the component that uses the reducer.  
    3. Use either context from components that need to read them.
