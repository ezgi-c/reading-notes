3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.  
**static**
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.  
**absolute positioning can be used to create UI that we need to lay over other elements on the page such as pop-up boxes, control menus, rollover panels, etc.**
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?  
**In absolute positioning the element lays over other elements; fixed positioning does the same thing except the element moves up or down when we scroll to stay visible in the viewport.**
