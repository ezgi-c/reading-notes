# Prep: Practice in the Terminal

## The Command Line

The command line is where we talk to our computers and tell them what to do. In our courses, we have been using it mostly to make directories and files, pusblish to GitHub and install libraries for applications. As a Mac user, I get to my command line from Applications > Utilities > Terminal.

## Basic Navigation

- `pwd` command displays the diretory we are currently in
- `ls` command lists the files in the directory
- `cd` command allows us to change to another directory

## More About Files

- `file` command followed by file path, displays what type of file it is
- `ls -a` lists all files in a directory, including hidden ones

## Manual Pages

- `man` followed by a command displays information about the comman and its uses
Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.
- `man -k` followed by a search term searches all the manuals for the term.
- `/` followed by a term searches for the term within a manual
- `n` selects the next search match

## File Manipulation

- `mkdir`: create a directory
- `rmdir`: delete a directory
- `touch`: create a blank file
- `cp`: copy file/directory
- `mv`: move or rename file/directory
- `rm`: delete a file
- Command line does not have an undo feature
