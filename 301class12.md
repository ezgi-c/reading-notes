## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

    - 100’s = Informational status codes; tells the client the request has been received.
    - 200’s = Success codes, tells the client the request has been accepted.
    - 300’s = Redirection codes; tells the client the resource does not exist at the requested location and to try their request for a different location.
    - 400’s = Client error codes; invalid request from client due to incorrect input.
    - 500’s = Server error codes; indicate overwhelmed or unreachable servers; client is recommended to retry the request.

1. What is a status code 202?  
    This code tells the client their request is valid and accepted but it will take time to process and respond to the request.
1. What is a status code 308?  
    This code stands for Permanent Redirect, tells the client to use another URL to access the resource.
1. What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?  
    204 No Content
1. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?  
    410 Gone
1. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?  
    The client does not have permission to access the resource even if they were authorized or the resource doesn't require authorization.

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?  
    Because when we deploy our application we will not be using localhost.
1. What is middleware?  
    Code that runs when the server gets a request but before it passes to the routes.
1. What does `app.use(express.json())` do?  
    Lets our server accept `json` as a body instead of a `POST` or `Git` element.
1. What does the `/:id` mean in a route?  
    It is used for getting one route and signifies a parameter.
1. What is the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`?  
    `PUT` updates all data, `PATCH` updates specified piece of data.
1. How do you make a default value in a schema?  
    Add a property called `default:` and give it a value.
1. What does a `500` error status code mean?  
    There is a server error.
1. What is the difference between a status `200` and a status `201`?  
    `200` is a success code and `201` is more specifically the success code for creating an object.
