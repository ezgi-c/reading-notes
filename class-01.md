The topics for this reading assignment are a review of foundational concepts in web development. These are important to go over as we will be building upon these principles in the course.

## Getting Started with Web Development

1. **Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.**

*Hypertext Transfer Protocol*  
*HTTP*  
*Computers talk to each other*  
*Just like you and me*  
*Syntax, Semantics, Timing, are the elements we need*  
*When we send a message to the server, we get a response indeed*

2. **Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.**

The browser first parses the HTML file. After recognizing links to CSS and JavaScript files, it sends a request to the server to parse these files.

3. **How can you find images to add to a Website?**

We can find images on Google search. It is best to filter the images to find images with "Creative Commons License" to avoid violating copyright.

4. **How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?**

A string is created by putting quotation marks around a value. i.e. `'value'`, `'23'`, etc.  
Numbers do not have quotation marks around them. i.e. `5`, `3+4` etc.

5. **What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?**

Variable are containers we use to store values. Variables are important for creating dynamic elements as their value can be changed by user input and other factors.
