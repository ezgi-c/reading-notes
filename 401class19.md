## AWS SQS vs SNS

1. What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?  
SQS (Simple Queue Service) is used for decoupling applications by queuing messages; SNS (Simple Notification Service) distributes several copies of a message to several subcscribers.
1. What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?  
SQS: simple queue with no additional requirements, decoupling applications, one sunscriber.
SNS: publish and consume batches of messages, same message processed in multiple ways, multiple subscribers.

## AWS SNS and SQS

1. Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.  
    1. create an SNS Topic in AWS Console
    2. create multiple SQS queues
    3. subscribe the SQS Queues to the SNS Topic
    4. publish a message to the SNS Topic, which is then delivered to the subscribed SQS Queues
    5. retrieve messages from the SQS Queues
1. Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.  
The push notifications work the same way as the fanout pattern. Except, instead of SQS Queues, mobile devices are subscribed to an SNS Topic to receive notifications.

## SQS and SNS Basics

1. How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?

- load balancing
- asynchronous processing
- decoupling components
- message buffer
- disaster recovery
