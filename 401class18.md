# Class 18 - AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?  
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale. It handles the HTTP requests to the API endpoints and routes them to correct backends.
1. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?  
Amazon API Gateway conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution with its ability to trigger execution of Serverless functions directly in response to HTTP requests. 
1. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?  

- AWS Lambda: run Lambda functions to generate HTTP API responses.
- AWS SNS: publish SNS notifications when an HTTP endpoint is accessed.
- Amazon Cognito: provide authentication and authorization for HTTP APIs.

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

1. What is DynamoDB?  
DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by AWS.
1. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?  

- Applications with large amount of data and strict latency requirements
- Serverless applications using AWS Lambda
- Data sets with simple, known access patterns

## AWS DynamoDB

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.  
DynamoDB can be explained as a filing cabinet used for storing information. As in a filing cabinet, information can be categorized and grouped together for easy retrieval and use.

## Dynamoose

1. What is Dynamoose?  
Dynamoose is a modeling tool for DynamoDB, and is inspired by Mongoose.
1. What are some key features of Dynamoose?  

- Type safety
- High level API
- Easy to use syntax
- DynamoDB Single Table Design Support
- Ability to transform data before saving or retrieving items
- Strict data modeling (validation, required attributes, and more)
- Support for DynamoDB Transactions
- Powerful Conditional/Filtering Support
- Callback & Promise support
