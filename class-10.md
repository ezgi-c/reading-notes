# Class 10 - Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.  
    Syntax error refers to errors in code such as a misspeliing or missing characters. Logic error means our code doesn't do what we need it to do.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.  
    I have encountoured both syntax and logic errors. Syntax errors were easy to fix as long as I was able to locate the error. Logic errors are alot harder to fix because I had to figure out exactly why the code is not working. Some ways I fixed those errors were using the console, refactoring my code, and asking for help from TAs and instructors.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?  
    I highly anticipate to make many more errors in my career and I beleive it will be vital to my job to know how to identify and fix errors.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  
    It is a tool we can access in the browser that helps us pause our code to identify the error in code and locate the place where it malfunctions so we can fix it.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.  
    Breakpoint in the JavaScript Debugger is where we can pause our code.
3. What is the call stack?  
    It is a section of the debugger that shows which code was executed to get the current line.
