# Class 15 - Authentication

## What is OAuth

1. What is OAuth?  
    Authorization protocol which allows unrelated servers to allow access to their resources without sharing the initial, related log-on credential.
1. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.  
    An example would be using Google account to log into an unrelated website.
1. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?  
    >
    > 1. The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
    > 1. The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
    > 1. The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
    > 1. The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
    > 1. If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
    > 1. The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
    > 1. The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
    > 1. The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
    > 1. The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
    > 1. The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
    > 1. The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

1. What is OpenID?  
    OpenID is an authentication protocol as opposed to OAuth which is an authentication protocol.

## Authorization and Authentication flows

1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?  
    Authentication allows user to login to an application while authorization allows the application to access resources from a server.
1. What is Authorization Code Flow?  
    Authorization Code Flow exchanges an authorization code for an access token.
1. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?  
    This protocol build upon Authorization Code Flow and provides additional security with use of a Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).
1. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?  
    An alternative to the Authorization Code Flow, intended for Public Clients, or applications which are unable to securely store Client Secrets.
1. What is Client Credentials Flow?  
    Used in applications or services running on your back-end, authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user.
1. What is Device Authorization Flow?  
    Used in input-constrained devices, which ask the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device, rather than authenticate the user directly.
1. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?  
    Only used in highly-trusted applications, which request that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form. Should only be used when redirect-based flows (like the Authorization Code Flow) cannot be used.
