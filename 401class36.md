# Class 36 Reading: Application State with Redux

## [Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

1. What is the first principle of Redux?  
    Entire state of an application is stored in a single store rather than distributed among multiple components or modules.

2. What is a store, and what do we use our reducers for within that store?  

    - A __store__ is where the application state is stored. Its job is to identify various reducers and middleware that need to be made available and used globally.  
    - We use our __reducers__ to hold and manage state for each part of the larger application state.  

3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.  

    - `getState()` : retrieves current state of the Redux store.
    - `dispatch()` : lets us dispatch actions to change the state of application.
    - `subscribe()` : lets us register a callback that the Redux store will call anytime an action has been dispatched.

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what `combineReducers()` does and why it is useful.  
    In the Redux store, to hold and manage our application state, we use reducer functions. We create multiple reducers to handle state for different parts of the application. `combineReducers()` combines multiple reducers and returns a single reducer function to centralize the state management of the application.
