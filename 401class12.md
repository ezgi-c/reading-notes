# Class 12 - Socket.io

## Web Sockets

1. What is a Web Socket?  
WebSocket is a protocol that enables real-time bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single, long-lived connection.

1. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.  
    - To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request, for which the server returns a WebSocket handshake response.
    - Once the connection is established, both the client and the server can send messages to each other over the same connection, without the need for additional HTTP requests.

1. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a <u>request</u> from that client.

## Socket.io Tutorial

1. What does the event handler `io.on()` do?  
The `io.on()` event handler handles connection and disconnection events, using the socket object.

1. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

> ```js
>//Whenever someone connects this gets executed
>io.on('connection', function(socket){
>   console.log('A user connected');
> //Whenever someone disconnects this piece of code executed
>   socket.on('disconnect', function () {
>       console.log('A user disconnected');
>   });
>});
>```

1. What does `socket.emit()` do?  
`socket.emit()` function is used for creating and firing custom events.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).  
WebSocket is the protocol and Socket.IO is the library to work with WebSocket.

1. When would you use Socket.IO?  
We would use Socket.IO when building a real-time JavaScript application with more convenient API.

1. When would you use WebSockets?  
We would use WebSockets when building a real-time application with a custom protocol or if we want to use a different programming language on the server side.

## OSI Model Explained

1. What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?

- Open System Interconnection Model (OSI): How data is transferred from one computer to another.
- OSI Model is divided into 7 layers, each of which has a specific function and communicates with the layers above and below it.

## TCP Handshakes Explained

1. Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend

- With Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), data can be delivered successfully and accurately.
- Before data is transmitted, TCP will use a '3-way handshake' to establish a connection.
- The TCP handshake is a series of steps between client (device requesting the information) and server (device providing the information) to make sure they can communicate.  
    step 1 - client sends a 'hello' message to server asking if it is available to talk  
    step 2 - server receives message, responds with 'yes, im available'  
    step3 - client receives the 'yes, im available' message and responds to the server with 'great, let's talk'

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
My learning goals are to understand and implement WebSockets/Socket.IO, events, OSI Model, and messaging.
