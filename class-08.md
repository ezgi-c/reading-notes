# Class 08 - CSS Layout

## Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

    This means that we can control alignment of items only on one axis, either items on a row or on a column, but not both at the same time.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

    Main axis is set by the `flex-direction` property. If it is set to `row` than cross axis is `column`, and vice versa.

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

    Using properties that can reverse order of items can impact accessibility. Problems can arise for screen readers when the order of items in the HTML is different than the order set by flex properties.

4. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

    We are able to have layout designs with flexbox that are too difficult or impossible to achieve with float or positioning.

5. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?

    I have not decided which direction to go for the certificate class yet. But if I choose to work with front-end development,  these design tools would be very useful.
