## How Computers Work

- All computers do 4 things
  - Input
  - Storage
  - Processing
  - Output
- All input is translated into ***binary***: 1's and 0's
  - Everything from numbers to letters to sounds to images is able to be tranlated to binary through combinations of 1's and 0's.
  - 1's and 0's are physically correlated to wires which either have current (1) or they don't (0)
- CPU = Central Processing Unit
  - controls all circuits of the computer
  - softwares tell CPU what to do
- The Operating System (OS) controls softwares which control the hardwares
