# Class 29 - Component Lifecycle / `useEffect` Hook

## effects hook

1. What purpose does `useEffect` serve in a function component compared to its counterpart(s) in class components?  
`useEffect` serves as a combination of `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` React class lifecycle methods. [For example](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html):
>  
``` js
// Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  ```

1. When using the useEffect Hook:
    1. What does `useEffect` do?  
    `useEffect` hook runs a callback with every component render.  
    It is effectively an event listener, where the event is a changed variable value
    1. Why is `useEffect` called inside a component?  
    Calling `useEffect` inside a component makes it possible for us to use the variables within the scope of the component such as state or any props.

1. Explain the importance of properly implementing effects with Cleanup  
    - ensures that effects are properly managed and released when no longer needed
    - prevents memory leak and other performance issues
