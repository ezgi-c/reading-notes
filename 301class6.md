    Each programmer takes on the role of either Navigator or Driver. The Driver is responsible for mechanical aspects of programming such as typing out the code, switching between windows and running tests. The Navigator is reponsible for bigger pictures aspects including thinking about the algorithm and verbalizing the code that needs to be written as well as doing research on their computer without typing the actual code.
