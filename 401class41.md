# Class 41 Readings: PWA & App Manifest

## What are PWAs

1. What does Progressive in Progressive Web App mean?  
When a web app is progressive, it means that new capabilities are enabled in modern browsers. The app becomes more reliable and can be installed by anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase.

1. What are three benefits of writing a progressive web app, as opposed to a native app?  
   - Capable
   - Reliable
   - Installable

1. What are two reasons to consider a native app, instead of a PWA?  
   - Native apps can access more device features such as cameras, GPS, etc.
   - Native apps are platform specific and can offer better performance since they are optimized for that platform's hardware and software.

## App Manifests

1. When a website has an app manifest, what is it able to do?  
The app manifest tells the browser about our PWA and how it should behave when installed on the user's desktop or mobile device.

1. Name and describe how short_name and two other manifest properties are used.  
   - `short_name` is used on the user's home screen, launcher, or other places where space may be limited.  
   - `start_url` is required and tells the browser where your application should start when it is launched.  
   - `scope` defines the set of URLs that the browser considers to be within your app. `start_url` must reside within the `scope`.

1. How does Chrome render a PWA splash screen?  
Chrome automatically creates the splash screen from the following manifest properties:
   - `name`
   - `background_color`
   - `icons`
