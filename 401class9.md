# Class 9 - Authorization/Authentication

1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.  
The project involves creating an API Auth server with a partner, implementing pair programming. Majority of the project will involve implementing the concepts we have learned so far. Creating Auth routes for users to signup, signin, and be assigned roles. We will get to be creative with the sort of data we want to use for our API. I had not come up with and idea myself but I have been partnered up with Vida who pitched making a Star Trek app and we are working on that now :).

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the [class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-09/)?  
My learning goals are to implement what we have learned so far, including data modeling, authentication/authorization and TDD, in a team setting. I hope to feel more prepared for midterm projects after this lab.
