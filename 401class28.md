# Class 28 - Advanced State with Reducers

## Reading

### useReducer hook

1. Name an alternative to the `useState` Hook.  
An alternative to `useState` Hook is the `useReducer` Hook
1. Why might the `useReducer` Hook be preferable to the `useState` Hook?  
The `useReducer` Hook is preferable to the `useState` Hook for complex state logic involving multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on a previous one.
1. What are two ways to set the initial state?  
    - Pass the initial state as a second argument
    - 'Lazy initialization', pass an `init` function as the third argument

### Ultimate Guide to useReducer

1. In terms of state, what does `useReducer` expect to receive as a parameter?  
It accepts a `reducer` function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
1. What does `useReducer` return?  
An array with two elements:
    1. current state value
    2. a dispatch function for updating the state
1. Explain `dispatch` to a non-technical recruiter.  
The `dispatch` function receives instructions for what we want executed in the application. It sends the type of action we want to execute to the `reducer` function to perform its job, which is updating the state.

## Reflection

1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
My learning goals are to understand reducers, actions, dispatching, and be able to manage state using `useReducer()`.
