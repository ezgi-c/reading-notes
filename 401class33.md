## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?  
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have to the network.
1. Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles. 

RBAC Example: Online Blog

| Role      | CRUD operations |
| --------- | ----------------|
| Admin     |  Create, Read, Update, Delete  |
| Editor    |  Read, Update  |
| Writer    |  Create, Read |
| Auth User |  Read |


1. What are the Benefits of RBAC?  
The main benefit of RBAC is information security. By granting access to network on a need-to-know basis, based on a user's role, security is more easily maintained. Other benefits of RBAC include reducing admin work, maximizing operational efficiency, and improving compliance with regulations.
