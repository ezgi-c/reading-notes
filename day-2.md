## choosing a text editor

- there are different kinds of text editors
- a text editor is what we use to write and edit code
- the most basic text editor comes readily in our computers; *Notepad* on Windows and *Text Edit* on Mac
- more advanced text editors are usually preferred by coders. these editors come with functions such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and themes and extensions
- the common editors used are *Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, Sublime Text, etc.*
