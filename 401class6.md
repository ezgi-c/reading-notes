# Class 6 - Authentication

## Securing Passwords

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.  
Hashing is turning a password into a string of characters. The hash is then safely stored in a database.
1. What is Bcrypt?  
Bcrypt is a password hashing algorithm.
1. Why might you use something like Bcrypt?  
Bcrypt is effective in protection against brute force attacks with utilization of a security factor.

## Basic Auth

1. What is Basic Authentication?  

> In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request.

1. What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?  
`Authorization` field with a value that contains the word `Basic` followed by a space and the base64-encoded username and password.
1. How are `username:password` in Basic Auth encoded?
Username and password are combined into a single string with a `:` separating them, then encoded using base64.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

1. Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.  
Authentication is the process of verifying identity of a user or device. Methods of authentication include password-based authentication, two-factor authentication, biometric authentication, and token-based authentication.
1. How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?  
For HTTP error messaging, the correct HTTP status code should be returned.
For HTML error messaging, a user-friendly message should be displayed to the user.
Designing clear, concise, user-friendly error messaging makes it easier to understand and solve issues.
