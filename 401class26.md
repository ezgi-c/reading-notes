# Class 26 - Component Based UI

## Reading

### react hello world

1. What are the building blocks of a React app?  
   Building blocks of a React app are elements and components. 
1. What is the difference between an element and a React component?  
    An element is a plain JavaScript object that represents a DOM element. 
    A component is a function or a class that returns an element.

    ```js
    // element:
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    // component:
    function header() {
        return <h1>Hello World</h1>
    }
    ```

1. What are some advantages of React’s component based architecture?  
Using component based architecture, we can create complex apps from small resuable pieces.

### introducing JSX

1. What is JSX and why do we use it?  
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and it produces React 'elements'.  
For example:

    ```js
    const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>
    ```

    We use JSX because React separates concerns into components that contain both rendering and other UI logic instead of putting them into separate files. This provides more useful error handling.

1. Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.  
Any valid JavaScript expression can be embedded into JSX by wrapping it curly braces.  
For example:

    ```js
    // JS expression
    function sum(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    // JSX
    const element = <p>The total is: {sum(1,2)}</p> 
    ```

1. Is it safe to embed user input in JSX? Explain.  
Yes. JSX converts everything into a string before being rendered, thus ensuring it is not possible to inject anything that is not explicitly written in the application.

### rendering elements

1. Explain what a React Component is to a non-technical friend.  
We can explain a React Component in the following way. When we open up a website, it has a header, body and navigation menu. Each of this sections can be built as a React component. When we update the header component, it will update it everywhere the component is used.

1. Describe mutability and React Components, specifically, how is the UI updated?  
React elements are immutable, meaning, once you create an element, you can't change its children or attributes. When a change is required, a new element is created with the updated values.

1. If changes are made to the UI, what does React update?  
When changes are mede to the UI, React updates the virtual DOM by creating a new tree of the virtual DOM elements that represent the updated UI. It then compares the new virtual DOM tree with the previous one and determines which parts of the DOM need to be updated.

## Additional Questions

1. Note the naming conventions in the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide. What pattern(s) do you see?  

    - use `.jsx` extension for React components
    - use PascalCase for file names
    - use PascalCase to reference React Components and camelCase for their instances.
    - use the file name as the component name
    - for root components of a directory, use `index.jsx` as file name and directory name as the component name
    - avoid using DOM component prop names for different purposes

1. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?  
I look forward to revisiting React from where we left of in the previous class, and gaining more skills and tools in the front end.
1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?  
My learning goals are to refresh my memory in working with React and improve my understanding and usage.
