# Class 10 - Stacks and Queues

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

In comparison, a Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle; the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed
